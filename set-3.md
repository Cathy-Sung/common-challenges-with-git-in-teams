# Challenge Set 3

1. Let's generate a conflict! Have each teammate create a new branch and change the first header in the `README.md` file. Each person should then open a pull request. Designate a single individual to merge their changes first. Every remaining pull request should now have a merge conflict. Talk amongst your team about how to fix it from the web interface. Have one person attempt it. Is someone willing to try fixing it on their local environment?
